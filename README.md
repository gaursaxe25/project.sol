Decentralized Content Monetization Platform
Project Description
A blockchain-based platform that allows content creators to monetize their digital content securely and transparently without intermediaries. The platform enables direct creator-to-consumer relationships, where creators can publish content with set prices, and consumers can purchase access to the content with full transparency of where their money goes.

Project Vision
Our vision is to revolutionize the digital content industry by eliminating intermediaries and giving creators full control over their work. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to create a more equitable ecosystem where creators receive a higher percentage of revenue from their content while consumers enjoy lower prices and clearer value attribution.

Key Features
Content Publishing: Creators can publish their content with custom pricing
Direct Payments: Consumers pay creators directly with minimal platform fees
Transparent Earnings: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring complete transparency
Immutable Ownership: Content ownership and access rights are secured through smart contracts
Automated Royalties: Creators receive payments automatically when their content is purchased
Future Scope
Integration with decentralized storage solutions like IPFS for content hosting
Implementation of subscription models for recurring creator support
Creator reputation and rating systems
Content curation and discovery mechanisms
Secondary marketplace for reselling content access rights
Revenue sharing models for collaborative content creation
Cross-chain interoperability for broader access
Integration with existing creator platforms
